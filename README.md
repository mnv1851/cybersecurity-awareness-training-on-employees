# cybersecurity-awareness-training-on-employees

## Introduction
### Background
In today's digitally interconnected world, organizations are quickly dependent on the safe information system to maintain the protection and operation of the data. However, despite the technological progress, the human error is an important contributor to cyber security violations (Parsons et al., 2017). Organizations all over the world face the challenge of promoting a cybersecurity aware labour, as attackers quickly exploit human behaviour instead of technical errors (Bada et al., 2019). Recognizing this has many companies gone against cyber security among employees to cultivate an active security culture.

The purpose of training in cyber security is not only to inform employees about the dangers and best practices, but also to create a sense of responsibility for maintaining information security (Puhakainen and Siponen, 2010). While these programs have significant investments, the real impact on the perception of employees about the organization's security culture is understood from a qualitative point of view. It is necessary to understand this view, as it shows how employees do internally and work on security policy.
## Significance of the Study
The importance of this study is looking for how training in cyber security affects employees' involvement and commitment to culture for safety. By focusing on employees' living experiences and attitudes, this study contributes valuable qualitative insight into the efficiency of such training programs - a field is traditionally dominated by quantitative examination or match matrix (Alshaikh et al., 2018). This insight can guide organizations in the design of more meaningful and attractive safety awareness initiatives.
## Research Question
<ul>
<li>How does cybersecurity awareness training affect employees’ perception of their organization’s security culture?<li>

## Hypothesis
Employees who undergo regular cybersecurity awareness training perceive their organization’s security culture more positively than those who do not.
Rationale of the Study
While previous research has evaluated awareness training in terms of behaviour (Puhakainen and Siponen, 2010), fewer studies have captured their interpretation of subjective experiences of employees and their explanation of organizational values around security. This study deals with gap by using a qualitative approach to highlight topics related to open investigative concept, inspiration and faith. Since security culture is not only based on rules, but how people feel and think of them (Tsouhou et al., 2015), this research provides a deep understanding of human factors affecting cybersecurity efficiency.
## Theoretical Background
This study is based in the Theory of employee behaviour (TPB), which suggests that an individual's approach, subjective criteria and perceived behavioural control affect their intentions and behaviour. When it comes to cyber security, awareness training can shape the approaches and criteria of security practices, thus changing behaviour and perception potentially (Bada et al., 2019).). By analysing employees’ responses through the TPB lens, this study seeks to explain how training might influence their view of organizational security culture — not just their compliance actions.
## Keywords
Cybersecurity awareness, security culture, employee perception, qualitative research, cybersecurity training, human factors, information security.
Literature Review
Introduction
Training organizations for cyber security have emerged as a strategic tool for reducing human security risk. Human factor is often cited as the weakest link in the safety chain, and many breaches are not caused by technical errors, but lack of awareness, negligence or social engineering (Parsons et al., 2017). While technical controls remain essential, fostering a strong security culture through employee engagement has become equally critical. This review examines existing literature related to cybersecurity awareness, employee behaviour, security culture, and the psychological and organizational factors that shape security-related perceptions.

## Cybersecurity Awareness and Training
Awareness training programs are designed to educate employees about threats, policies, and best practices. According to Puhakainen and Siponen (2010), such training is most effective when integrated with organizational culture and tailored to real-world situations employees face. Their action research study demonstrated that contextual and behaviourally anchored training can significantly improve compliance. Similarly, Bada, Sasse, and Nurse (2019) emphasized that traditional training often fails because it overlooks behavioral science principles and assumes that knowledge automatically leads to behavior change.
Organizations that invest in continuous, interactive training — rather than one-time sessions — are more likely to foster long-term behavioural change (Puhakainen & Siponen, 2010). Alshaikh et al. (2018) further suggested that awareness programs should involve storytelling, examples of internal incidents, and scenario-based learning to make the training more relatable and effective.

## Perception of Security Culture
Security culture refers to the collective mindset, values, and practices regarding cybersecurity within an organization. Tsohou, Karyda, and Kokolakis (2015) found that employee perception of security culture is shaped not just by formal policies but also by informal communication, peer behaviour, and management commitment. When employees perceive that cybersecurity is prioritized by leadership and embedded in everyday operations, they are more likely to internalize secure practices.
Parsons et al. (2017) developed the Human Aspects of Information Security Questionnaire (HAIS-Q), which links employee awareness with security-related behaviours. Although more quantitative in nature, their findings underscore the importance of perception — employees who understood and valued the training tended to adopt more secure behaviours and viewed their organizations more positively.

## Challenges in Awareness Training Effectiveness
Despite their potential, awareness campaigns often face limitations. Bada et al. (2019) argued that many initiatives focus on compliance rather than culture, which may result in temporary behaviour changes without long-term mindset shifts. Moreover, employee scepticism, over-saturation of information, and lack of personalization can diminish training impact.
Alshaikh et al. (2018) emphasized the need to address cultural diversity and different risk perceptions within organizations. Their qualitative interviews revealed that employees from different departments or regions often interpret the same training differently, which can influence their engagement and sense of responsibility toward cybersecurity.

Linking Awareness Training to Perception: A Qualitative Gap
Most studies agree that awareness training influences behaviour, but few have qualitatively explored how such training affects perception — how employees feel about their organization's security posture and their role in it. This is a critical gap, as perception drives motivation and voluntary compliance.
This study shows how employees describe their experiences with cyber security awareness programs, and these experiences shape their understanding of participation in organizational preferences, trust and cyber security efforts.
## Methodology
### Research Design
This study used a qualitative secondary data analysis design, which affects the notion of employees about the security culture in their organization by using thematic analysis to find out about training in cyber security awareness. Instead of conducting primary interview or examination, I analysed five published qualitative research articles as data sources. This approach allowed me to synthesize and interpret the existing qualitative conclusions through my own analytical frameworks, which focus on the recurring patterns and topics related to consciousness training, human behaviour and organizational culture.

## Thematic Analysis Procedure
After collecting the five qualitative research studies, I carefully read and re-read the findings and discussion sections of each. Using inductive thematic analysis, I extracted meaningful patterns and grouped them into themes that addressed the research question.
The analytical process followed these steps:
Familiarization with data – I immersed myself in the finding’s sections of all five studies to understand the context and tone of employee responses and interpretations.
Initial coding – I highlighted key ideas, statements, and interpretations related to employee training and perceptions of security.
Generating themes – I clustered the codes into broader themes that represented shared meanings or repeated concepts.
Reviewing and refining themes – I refined and named themes to ensure clarity and relevance to the research focus.

## Data Analysis
### Introduction
This chapter presents the findings from the study based on the thematic analysis of five qualitative research articles. The purpose was to understand how training in cyber security affects the perception of employees about the security culture in the organization. By interpreting the original data through my own analytical lens, I was able to achieve the subjects that answer direct research questions:
"How does cybersecurity awareness training affect employees’ perception of the organizational security culture?"
The themes were developed inductively and reflect patterns found across the data sources. Each theme is presented and discussed below with supporting insights drawn from the analysed material.
________________________________________
Training Enhances Awareness but Requires Contextualization
Across all five studies, training programs were shown to improve employee knowledge of cybersecurity threats. However, I found that training was most impactful when it was context-specific and directly linked to the employee's work environment. Abstract or generic modules were often ignored or quickly forgotten, while scenario-based, interactive sessions were more memorable. This finding supports the hypothesis that awareness training positively influences employee perception — but only when designed to be engaging and relevant.
________________________________________
The perception of organizational culture depends on leadership communication
A recurring theme was that the notion of employees about the organization's security culture is strongly influenced by the visibility and clarity of leadership communication. When management actively supported the Cyber Security initiative, the employees felt that security was a general responsibility, not just an IT problem. Participation in this management shaped how employees explained the organization's overall commitment and often improved the desire to follow policies.
________________________________________
Behaviour Change Is a Process, Not an Outcome
Another insight was that perception and behavior do not always shift simultaneously. Employees may recognize the importance of security after training but still resist behavior change due to habit, peer influence, or uncertainty. This suggests that perception is the foundation, but reinforcement over time is necessary to translate it into lasting cultural change. This theme underlines the value of ongoing awareness efforts rather than one-time campaigns.
________________________________________
Engagement Varies by Department and Role
The data also revealed that employee perception of security culture was not uniform across the organization. Departments with technical responsibilities were generally more engaged with training, while administrative or support teams viewed it as less relevant. This variation can create inconsistencies in how security culture is perceived and applied, highlighting the need for tailored messaging.
________________________________________
Training Alone Is Insufficient Without Cultural Integration
Finally, I observed that even well-designed training programs fail when not embedded in a supportive culture. Employees reported feeling overwhelmed by information or disconnected from policy changes if there was no ongoing dialogue or peer reinforcement. The perception of safety culture is not only improved with awareness, but when security becomes part of everyday language, meetings and behaviour in the organization.
________________________________________

### Summary
The analysis indicates that the training staff for cyber security affects the perception positively, but the effect is driven by factors such as relevant design, management communication, departmental differences and cultural reinforcement. These findings support the hypothesis that awareness training contributes to a strong perception of security culture, but also shows that training alone is not enough - it should be part of a comprehensive organizational strategy.
## Conclusion and Recommendations
### Conclusion
This study explored the relationship between cybersecurity awareness training and employees’ perception of their organization's security culture through a secondary qualitative analysis of five research articles. The primary aim was to examine whether such training efforts influence how employees view their role and responsibility in maintaining cybersecurity within the workplace.
The findings, interpreted through my own thematic analysis, revealed that awareness training does enhance employee perceptions — particularly when it is contextual, engaging, and reinforced through leadership communication. However, the study also showed that training alone is insufficient. A positive shift in perception requires organizational alignment, cultural integration, and tailored communication strategies that consider departmental differences and employee roles.
### Key themes included:
•	The need for training to be relevant and scenario-based.
•	Leadership’s role in shaping perception through consistent communication.
•	The gradual nature of behavioral change post-training.
•	Variability in training impact across roles.
•	The importance of embedding security into daily organizational culture.
These insights collectively support the hypothesis that cybersecurity awareness training positively impacts employee perception, but highlight that this relationship is complex and mediated by organizational factors.

## Implications for Practice
The findings suggest several practical implications for cybersecurity leaders, HR managers, and policy designers:

•	Customize training content to reflect specific roles and departments.
•	Involve leadership visibly in training initiatives to signal cultural importance.
•	Reinforce training over time through campaigns, simulations, or peer discussion.
•	Assess perceptions regularly using surveys or informal interviews to identify gaps.
•	Integrate security language into daily communication, staff meetings, and values.
These steps can help organizations move from isolated awareness sessions toward a more resilient, people-centred security culture.

## Limitations of the Study
This research was limited to secondary data sources and did not include the original data collection. While analysed articles were qualitative and relevant, they came from different organizational contexts and countries, which can limit direct generality. Moreover, my interpretations are subjective and shaped by the thematic focus I chose.
________________________________________
## Suggestions for Future Research

Future studies could:
•	Conduct primary qualitative research such as interviews or focus groups with employees post-training.
•	Compare perceptions before and after different types of training interventions.
•	Find out the long-term effects of awareness training on behaviour and culture.
•	Check cultural differences in perceptions in geographical areas or industries.________________________________________
Final Thoughts
Cybersecurity is no longer just a technical issue — it is deeply human. As this study has shown, how employees perceive security is as important as how they practice it. Awareness training, when delivered meaningfully and backed by strong cultural signals, can reshape those perceptions and contribute to a safer, more proactive workplace environment.
